## Using the C Renderer

The C renderer is likely to be faster than the Python renderer. To use the C renderer, it must be compiled first. To complile, run the command: `python3 setup.py build` in the root of the repository. Then run the game as normal and go into settings to switch the renderers.

Please report any bugs in the C renderer, or differences between the Python renderer and the C renderer in issues.
